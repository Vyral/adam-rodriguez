        <title>New Restrictions Mean Increased Mortgage Costs on Second Homes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ya9f6thAjRA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;New restrictions could make buying a second home much more costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest rates and fees on investment properties and vacation homes have been skyrocketing, and there are a few reasons why. On March 10, Fannie Mae placed tighter restrictions on the number of second home/investment property mortgages that lenders can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae is one of the big banks that purchases loans after they close. In the past, around 14% of Fannie Mae loans were allowed to be used for second homes and investment properties. Due to the aforementioned restrictions, that percentage has been slashed in half to around 7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many lenders depend on Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac when selling their loans, so these rules are putting a lot of strain on mortgage companies&lt;/strong&gt;. After the 7% cap is reached, these banks won’t be able to purchase any more loans. This also puts more risk on the lenders, as they could be stuck with loans that nobody wants to buy. However, they’re avoiding it by shifting the risk to buyers through higher loan costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=These new rules may also encourage lenders to be even more selective when it comes to working with buyers.%20http://localhost:4000/new-restrictions-mean-increased-mortgage-costs-on-second-homes.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“These new rules may also encourage lenders to be even more selective when it comes to working with buyers.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been reported that PennyMac, one of the largest loan servicing companies for these types of loans, has already added an additional 2.25% charge on loans for non-primary resident applicants. &lt;strong&gt;In other words, it costs more to get a mortgage on second homes or investment properties&lt;/strong&gt;. This also includes people with down payments of 25% or more, and those who pay less face an additional 5% cost. For example, if you wanted to borrow $300,000 for an investment property and put 20% down, you could face an additional $15,000 charge or a higher rate to compensate for the fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though criteria like credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and cash reserves aren’t affected, it’d still be wise to save up additional money for the down payment on a second home. This can help cover fees and rates that are likely to be much higher on loans that have less than 20% to 25% down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new rules may also encourage lenders to be even more selective when it comes to working with buyers. Even if you are selected, you can still expect to pay a higher rate—even when you’re in good financial shape—when buying a second home. The window of opportunity may be closing, but you can lower costs by increasing your credit score, paying debt, and saving up a sizable down payment. The strength of your application will matter more than ever, so these factors also help in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or would like to know what this means for you, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Comparing Our Traditional Listings and Guaranteed Offers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnTuZxuCoTI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some more great info on our guaranteed offer program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we launched our &lt;u&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://centralfloridarealestateblog.com/guaranteed-offer/&quot;&gt;guaranteed offer program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, we’ve been getting a lot of questions like, “What’s the difference between your traditional listing program and a guaranteed offer program?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference between the two programs is &lt;strong&gt;a matter of convenience.&lt;/strong&gt; With our guaranteed offer program, you can basically bypass the traditional home sale process and sell on your timeline. Once we submit your property to our investors, we can have multiple cash offers in as little as seven days. This means you can close quickly, save the time and money of preparing the home, forgo all showings and open houses, choose your closing date, and move on your timeline. Another great thing is that we’ll still be here to help you negotiate the best offer and terms so you’re not dealing with the investors on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Diverse home-selling needs call for diverse solutions.%20http://localhost:4000/comparing-our-traditional-listings-and-guaranteed-offers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Diverse home-selling needs call for diverse solutions.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;our traditional listing program will be the way for our seller clients &lt;em&gt;to make the most money possible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by putting their home on the open market. This involves a little more work by default, but we do our best to make it hassle-free for our sellers. We follow a 14-step marketing plan to help maximize your property’s value, we follow up with all showings, and we ultimately negotiate the best offer and terms so you can walk away with the most money possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s really no wrong choice. At the end of the day, it’s a matter of convenience. We understand that every seller’s situation is unique, so we want to offer two great solutions to help them reach the next stage of their lives. As always, feel free to reach out if you have questions about this or any other real estate topic. We’re happy to be a resource for you and assist with whatever buying, selling, or investing needs you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Is Good Faith Money Important?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJbQ0KFbYlY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center style=&quot;font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is good faith money and why is it important? Find out here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is good faith money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a buyer’s offer on a home is accepted, they’ll include a deposit called the earnest money deposit with a deadline on when the funds will be deposited to the escrow agent. Normally, the escrow agent is also the one who will handle the closing. The earnest money deposit is supposed to show good faith that the buyer is serious about purchasing the home, and it goes toward their down payment and closing cost at settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In central Florida, &lt;strong&gt;the normal earnest money amount is between 1% and 3% of the sales price&lt;/strong&gt;, though it can vary. If there are multiple offers on the home, a buyer might want to increase their earnest money deposit to make their offer look stronger to the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The earnest money deposit shows good faith that the buyer is serious about purchasing the home.%20http://localhost:4000/why-is-good-faith-money-important.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The earnest money deposit shows good faith that the buyer is serious about purchasing the home.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the buyer were to back out of the contract, both parties have to agree to this decision before the funds are released to either party. If the buyer has a home inspection contingency, finance or appraisal contingency, or another contingency, they can use them as options to void the contract and they will get their earnest money deposit back. Once the contingencies have expired, the earnest money deposit is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any real estate questions or needs, or if you know of anyone we can help, reach out to us anytime. We hope to hear from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When an Appraisal &amp; Contract Price Don’t Match</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8pOyOYkTJNM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a seller, here&amp;rsquo;s what you can do if your home&amp;rsquo;s appraisal comes in low.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens if your home’s appraised value doesn’t match its contract price? This is a legitimate concern for sellers in our market since so many listings are fetching multiple offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you can do is &lt;strong&gt;have your Realtor check the appraisal for errors&lt;/strong&gt;. Appraisers are super busy right now (along with everyone else), so there might be a typo somewhere in their report that threw everything off. In one of our client’s recent appraisals, for example, the home’s square footage was incorrect. After we identified the error and corrected it, everything was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there are no errors in the appraisal, your Realtor can submit a rebuttal&lt;/strong&gt;. In this situation, we’ll pull comparable sales in your neighborhood and show them to the lender. They’ll then decide whether any changes are necessary. This is still a challenge, though, and it doesn’t always work out in favor of the seller. However, it’s still an opportunity to increase the appraisal so that it’s closer to the contract price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Appraisers are super busy right now (along with everyone else), so there might be a typo somewhere in their report that threw everything off.%20http://localhost:4000/when-an-appraisal-contract-price-dont-match.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Appraisers are super busy right now (along with everyone else), so there might be a typo somewhere in their report that threw everything off.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If neither of these options work, your Realtor will have to go back to the drawing board and renegotiate with the buyer’s agent&lt;/strong&gt; to come up with an agreed-upon price. Buyers and sellers understand that the market has been increasing these past few years. If you work with us, we’ll negotiate a win-win price to get you the most money possible for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Most Common Forms of Property Ownership</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iq2GU7q3Z3o?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;re reviewing the most common forms of property ownership in our area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the most common forms of property ownership in Central Florida?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the answer, let’s start with a &lt;strong&gt;quick reminder: Title equals ownership&lt;/strong&gt;. Title can be held in two different ways, the first of which being as “severalty” (meaning it’s owned by an independent person or entity), and the second being as a “concurrent estate” (meaning it’s owned by more than one person at a given time). So, now that we’re clear on those definitions, let’s move on to the two most common forms of ownership for both individual owners and multiparty owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common forms of ownership for an individual in Central Florida are “fee simple” and “leasehold” ownership. &lt;strong&gt;Fee simple ownership is when an individual owns a piece of real estate outright&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning they own all the land, dwelling, and air rights to a property. Fee simple tenure is also considered indefinite, wherein the owner has the right to sell or dispose of the property as they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leasehold ownership is basically where a parcel of land and the building on that land have different owners&lt;/strong&gt;. So, in essence, the owner of the land is leasing the rights of the property to the tenant. Leasehold ownership is also referred to as “tenancy for years” because it generally lasts for a specific period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Title can be held in two different ways: 'severalty' or 'concurrent estate.'%20http://localhost:4000/the-most-common-forms-of-property-ownership.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Title can be held in two different ways: ‘severalty’ or ‘concurrent estate.’”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get a bit more complicated when two or more owners take title to a single piece of real property. In fact, there are several different kinds of multiparty ownership. The two main types of multiparty ownership in Central Florida are “tenants in common” and “joint tenants.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tenants in common refers to instances in which each owner retains separate rights over their share of the property&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, let’s say two people own the same commercial building together. The deed specifies that Person A owns 60% and Person B owns 40%. Person A can sell or give away their 60% without telling Person B because the sale would not affect Person B’s ownership of his 40% share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;if these co-owners were joint tenants, then each owner would have equal rights over the entire property&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, Person A could not sell a share of the property without Person B’s consent. Furthermore, if either co-owner were to die, the survivor would automatically take full possession of the property, a scenario which is also known as “joint tenants with rights of survivorship.” If you’re married, it’s called “tenant by the entireties,” which is basically the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this message helped clarify some property-related jargon you’ve heard being thrown around. If you have any questions about ownership or are interested in soon becoming a property owner yourself, reach out to us by phone or email anytime. We’re always happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Are Homestead Exemptions so Important?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvZBzTeYn1Q?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three main reasons why filing for a homestead exemption is so important.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today’s topic is especially important for anyone who bought a home this year: What is the homestead tax exemption, and why is it important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s determine what Florida property taxes actually do. Well, they help your city and local officials raise funds. They pay for police, firefighters, schools, roads, etc. Every November, the tax bills come out based on the assessed value of your property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s talk about the homestead exemption, what that is, and how it benefits you. First of all, your homestead property is considered your primary residence. Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;you can only homestead one property at a time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you're a veteran, disabled veteran, or senior citizen, you get additional exemptions.%20http://localhost:4000/why-are-homestead-exemptions-so-important.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you’re a veteran, disabled veteran, or senior citizen, you get additional exemptions.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first benefit of the homestead exemption is that you can get a discount on your property tax assessed value. Your tax assessed value is the amount the government can tax you on and is slightly less than your home’s market value. The general rule of thumb is that it’s about 85% of your market value. So for a $100,000 property, your tax assessed value is about $85,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the top, &lt;strong&gt;in the state of Florida, you get a $25,000 discount if you file as a single person and a $50,000 discount if you’re married&lt;/strong&gt;. So if you have a $50,000 exemption, you reduce that from the $85,000 to get your tax assessed value, and the government can only tax you on $35,000 of that. Also, if you’re a veteran, disabled veteran, or senior citizen, you get additional exemptions. Check with your local property appraiser’s office to see what exemptions you’re eligible for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second benefit of the homestead exemption is creditor protection. If for any reason you are sued civilly, they can’t touch your homestead or the equity on that property. So creditor protection is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third benefit is the 3% cap. In terms of tax assessed value, &lt;strong&gt;there is a ceiling on appreciation&lt;/strong&gt;; even in areas that have appreciated more than 3%, the maximum they can assess you is 3% per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this shines a little bit of light on the subject. If you have any further questions, give us a call at (407) 519-0627. We’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are the Benefits of a Buyer Consultation?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yq0RHClKevw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are buyer consultations so important to first-time homebuyers?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I want to address a question that often comes up, especially for new buyers: Why are buyer consultations important? There are three primary reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. They provide a detailed needs analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the first things we do during our buyer consultations is the needs analysis, which allows us to cater specifically to our clients’ needs and wants. We’ll discuss things like motivation, time frame, location, and home criteria. Using that information, we’ll be able to better search for homes on your behalf and only send you listings that meet your criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. They educate you on the current market and let you review the buying process&lt;/strong&gt;. The market is constantly moving, so when it’s time for you to buy, we want to make sure you have a great understanding of what’s happening based on up-to-date market statistics, not just our opinions. Since this may be your first time buying a home, we’ll also review the buying process with you and address any questions or concerns you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You’ll become familiar with your agent&lt;/strong&gt;. You’re preparing to purchase one of the largest assets of your life, and you should feel comfortable and confident that your agent will get the job done for you. Not every agent works the same, so this gives you the opportunity to interview your agent and make sure they have the skills, experience, and qualifications you’re looking for. There are no bad buyers—only bad Realtors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about buying a home, reach out to us. It’ll be our pleasure to walk you through the process to make sure your home buying experience is a great one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is a New Foreclosure Crisis Looming on the Horizon?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIKZxS1NUvg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are my thoughts about a possible foreclosure crisis on the horizon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I want to talk to you about a foreclosure crisis that might be looming on the horizon, and what it could mean for you. I’m sure you know how &lt;strong&gt;the pandemic and lockdowns have hurt the economy&lt;/strong&gt;. Many people have lost jobs or had their hours cut significantly. As a result, they are struggling to make regular mortgage payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably also heard about various forbearance programs. These are temporary private and government programs that allow mortgage borrowers to postpone or even reduce their monthly mortgage payments. As it stands, 3.7 million borrowers are in mortgage forbearance programs. That’s about 7% of all active mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these folks just hit the six-month mark of mortgage forbearance. The big question is what will happen in another six months when the maximum term for these forbearance programs comes to an end? That brings me to the possibility of a foreclosure crisis. Indeed, many people will still not be able to make their mortgage payments as forbearance programs run out. &lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, some will be forced into foreclosure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’m not expecting a scenario like 2008. The difference comes down to current sky-high home prices and record-low mortgage rates. These unique circumstances mean that most homeowners have equity in their homes right now. In fact, home equity for homeowners with a mortgage rose 6.6% annually in the second quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rise in equity means homeowners have options, even if they are struggling to make payments. In other words, they can put their homes on the market and sell them rather than lose them to foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=About 7% of all active mortgages are in forbearance.%20http://localhost:4000/is-a-new-foreclosure-crisis-looming-on-the-horizon.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“About 7% of all active mortgages are in forbearance.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for you? Well, &lt;strong&gt;the current real estate market is severely short on its supply of homes&lt;/strong&gt;. Homes are selling very quickly and at record prices simply because demand is so much higher than supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we don’t see a foreclosure crisis in the coming months (and I do not believe we will), there is likely to be a flood of new homes for sale on the market. It’s likely to put a chill on home price growth or even reverse it. We will enter a more balanced market, where buyers have more of a say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bring this up in case you have been thinking about selling soon but are still on the fence. The current moment might be golden. The lack of supply right now means you could sell quickly and for top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, whether you’re buying or selling, give us a call or send a quick email today. We have our fingers on the pulse of the Central Florida real estate market, and we can help you make the right decision for your specific circumstances. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
