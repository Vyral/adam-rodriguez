<center><em>The mortgage patch may expire soon and this could impact many people’s ability to qualify for a home loan. Here’s what you should know.</em></center>

<br>Mortgage rates are currently low but mortgages themselves might soon be hard to come by. After the financial crisis, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created something called a "qualified mortgage patch."

**This allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgages from borrowers who had debt-to-income ratios that were higher than normal**.

There were a lot of these mortgages — 3.3 million over the past five years, or over a quarter trillion dollars’ worth in the last year alone. In fact, mortgages that fell under **this "patch" accounted for 19% of all loans bought by Fannie and Freddie**. That's a huge chunk of the market, considering that Fannie and Freddie guarantee roughly half of all mortgages out there.

Now, here’s the news: **The "qualified mortgage patch" is set to expire in January of 2021**. Proposals that have come out in the past month seem to favor abolishing the patch, so Freddie and Fannie could no longer buy mortgages at the greater debt-to-income ratios.

How might this affect you? Well, **one obvious impact would be fewer homebuyers**.

At least some of the homebuyers who got a “patch mortgage” probably wouldn't have gotten a mortgage if the patch weren't in effect. In other words, abolishing the patch might mean fewer homebuyers, which will make it more difficult to sell a home.

**Second, there is likely to be an effect on home price growth**. The fewer buyers there are, the lower the demand. And lower approved mortgages means less money to spend on homes. In time, this could lead to a slowdown in home price growth or even a decrease in home prices.

**Third, these changes might make it more difficult for you to personally get a mortgage**. The large number of homebuyers who would no longer have access to Freddie and Fannie credit would have to look elsewhere. This might put added pressure on mortgage lenders — and make mortgages more difficult to obtain for everyone.

So are these changes something you should worry about?

Well, it's not 100% certain the qualified mortgage patch will be allowed to expire. Even if it is allowed to expire, it won't do so for another 18 months. But **if it does happen, it's not likely to benefit those who are looking to buy or sell a home**.

If you have been considering buying or selling, **it might be a good idea to get the process going before these changes come into effect**.
