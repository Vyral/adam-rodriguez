Whatâ€™s the latest news regarding COVID-19, the Florida economy, and our real estate market?

On May 8, **Governor DeSantis signed an executive order <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2020/EO_20-120.pdf">extending Florida&rsquo;s state of emergency for 60 days</a></u>, which means we can continue to receive federal assistance and resources**. On May 11, barbershops and hair salons were allowed to reopen. Furthermore, Disney Springs plans to begin reopening on May 20. There are a limited number of shopping and dining options that will be open while the rest of the park will remain closed.
