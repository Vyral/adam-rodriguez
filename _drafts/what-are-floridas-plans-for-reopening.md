We hope that you and your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. Governor DeSantis announced his plans to reopen the state of &nbsp;Florida starting on May 4, but phase one will exclude Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. The first phase is opening retail stores and restaurants at 25% capacity, resuming elective surgeries, continued distanced learning for schools, and more. In real estate, we’ve had a subtle decrease in home values in Lake County, but we’re hopeful that things will bounce back this summer.
