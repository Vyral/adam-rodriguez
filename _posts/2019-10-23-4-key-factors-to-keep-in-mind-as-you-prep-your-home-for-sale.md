To best prepare your home for the market, there are four key factors to keep in mind:

**1\. The market’s condition**. In a strong seller’s market, you don’t need to do much—there’s little inventory and not much competition. You can price your home reasonably and it will sell no matter what. This was the case here in central Florida until the end of 2017 when conditions started to shift.

**2\. Price point**. In the average price points, you don’t need to do a lot to sell a house. However, in the higher price points (i.e., $400,00 and above), your home’s condition becomes more and more of a factor.

**3\. Selling conditions in your neighborhood**. If every home in your neighborhood has granite countertops and yours has Formica, for example, that could negatively impact your sale. Also, if all the listings in your neighborhood are renovated and cleaned before they sell, you need to do the same to your home.

**4\. The resources at your disposal**. Do you have the money or skills to make the necessary changes to your home? If you don’t have the resources to do anything, you’ll have to use whatever strategies are available. Be sure to ask your Realtor for their advice on which approach to take.

Now, if you do find yourself in a situation with limited resources, the good news is that these four tips will help you regardless:

**1\. Declutter**. The more personal items you can remove from your home’s living areas, the better off you’ll be. Buyers want to be able to see themselves in your home, and decluttering doesn’t cost you a thing.

**2\. Paint**. Generally, painting is inexpensive. Repainting the entire interior of your house can cost as little as $2,000, and doing so will dramatically change the perception of your home.

**3\. Boost your home’s curb appeal**. First impressions are everything in real estate, so do everything you can to make the first glimpse buyers will have of your home look as good as possible. Cleaning up your front yard and updating your landscaping will take you far in this regard.

**4\. Eliminate odors**. If your home smells like pets or stale cigarettes, it may turn buyers off. These odors are relatively easy to get rid of, but you’ll have to do some research as to how.
