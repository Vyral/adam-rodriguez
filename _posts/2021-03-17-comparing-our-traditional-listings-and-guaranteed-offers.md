<center><em>Here&rsquo;s some more great info on our guaranteed offer program.</em></center>

<br>Since we launched our <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://centralfloridarealestateblog.com/guaranteed-offer/">guaranteed offer program</a></u>, we’ve been getting a lot of questions like, “What’s the difference between your traditional listing program and a guaranteed offer program?”

The biggest difference between the two programs is **a matter of convenience.** With our guaranteed offer program, you can basically bypass the traditional home sale process and sell on your timeline. Once we submit your property to our investors, we can have multiple cash offers in as little as seven days. This means you can close quickly, save the time and money of preparing the home, forgo all showings and open houses, choose your closing date, and move on your timeline. Another great thing is that we’ll still be here to help you negotiate the best offer and terms so you’re not dealing with the investors on your own.

On the other hand, **our traditional listing program will be the way for our seller clients *to make the most money possible*** by putting their home on the open market. This involves a little more work by default, but we do our best to make it hassle-free for our sellers. We follow a 14-step marketing plan to help maximize your property’s value, we follow up with all showings, and we ultimately negotiate the best offer and terms so you can walk away with the most money possible\!

So there’s really no wrong choice. At the end of the day, it’s a matter of convenience. We understand that every seller’s situation is unique, so we want to offer two great solutions to help them reach the next stage of their lives. As always, feel free to reach out if you have questions about this or any other real estate topic. We’re happy to be a resource for you and assist with whatever buying, selling, or investing needs you may have.
