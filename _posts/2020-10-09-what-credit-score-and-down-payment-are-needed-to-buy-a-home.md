<center><em>Here&rsquo;s what to know about credit score and down payment requirements.</em></center>

<br>Today we’re joined by our good friend <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://movement.com/lo/trey-delgreco/">Trey DelGreco with Movement Mortgage</a></u> to answer a two-part question: What is the minimum down payment and credit score needed to obtain a loan these days?

This is a question Trey hears all the time and the right answer depends on your situation. Typically, **the higher your credit score is, the less of a down payment you’ll need**, while a lower score will require a higher down payment.

**The target minimum for most loans is a 620 credit score**. You can get a conventional or FHA loan with this score, but you might need more of a down payment.

If you don’t have a big down payment or any down payment, there are options for you. There are down-payment assistance programs as well as 0% financing programs available. **Just be ready to have a higher credit score if you apply for one of those programs**. They typically require at least a 640 score.
