<center><em>Here are some ways you can save on your next mortgage or refinance.</em></center>

<br>Today we want to tell you about a few quick and easy ways to save hundreds or even thousands of dollars when you're refinancing or taking out a mortgage on a new home.

**First is a little-known option called an appraisal waiver**. In a nutshell, when a lender decides to give you a loan, they want to have a good idea of what your property is worth. The typical way they do this is by sending out an expert to examine the property. This appraisal typically costs between $270 and $750. As you can probably guess, it's you, the borrower, who is on the hook for paying this fee.

The appraisal waiver, on the other hand, is simply a way to skip this fee. **Instead of sending an expert to visit your home (or future home) in person, the lender uses analytics and calculations to figure out what your home is worth, without any inspection**.

This has been an option for a long time, but it's jumped up significantly in popularity over the past several months because of the pandemic and subsequent desire to do business virtually. Plus, an appraisal waiver saves you the money, time, and hassle of having an appraisal expert visit.

What's more, it could even result in a higher appraised value for your home, which would mean better terms for your new mortgage. But what if the virtual appraisal comes back with a number that's less than you hoped for?

**In that case, you can still request an in-person appraisal, or simply deal with another lender**. You're not bound in any way. You can see now why this is such a risk-free and easy way to shave off a few hundred dollars of fees when refinancing your home or taking out a new mortgage.

The second option is the <u><a target="_blank" href="https://kellermortgage.com/zeroplus/">ZeroPlus program through Keller Mortgage</a></u>. **When you refinance or take out a new loan with Keller Mortgage, there are no lender fees, no origination fees, PLUS they contribute $1,000 toward any third-party closing costs**.
