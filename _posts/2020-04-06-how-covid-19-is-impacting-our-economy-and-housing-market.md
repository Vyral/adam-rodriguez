<center><em>Here&rsquo;s how the coronavirus is affecting our housing market and economy.</em></center>

<br>With the coronavirus continuing to dominate our daily lives, it can be hard to keep up with all the latest news, but today we’ll update you on how it’s affecting our economy and housing market. The good news is, according to <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.zillow.com/research/pandemic-literature-review-26643/">a recent Zillow study</a></u>, **the behavior of the housing market during previous pandemics paints a reassuring picture for sellers**. Home sales dropped, but prices stayed roughly the same. Essentially, the market shifts into “pause” mode during these situations.

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help.
