Are you hoping to get top dollar for your home sale but don’t have the money to fix it up, don’t know any contractors, and don’t know where to start? We have a solution for you\! This program is a complete game-changer and is going to be able to help a lot of people.

Without further ado, I’m excited to announce that our team is officially certified for Keller Williams’ Ready to Sell program which allows you to repair or renovate your home before putting it on the market with $0 out of pocket.

**The Ready to Sell program gives you 2 different options:**

**1\. Apply for 0% financing** for the cost of the renovation through one of our preferred partners. Once the property sells, you’ll be able to pay that back with $0 upfront.

**2\. Access the equity you already have in your home**. If you have enough equity, we’ll be able to leverage it for the cost of the renovation and pay the contractor back once your home sells with $0 upfront.

The key phrase to note here is “$0 upfront.”

This money can be used for small projects such as paint, pressure washing, landscaping, and flooring, or it can be used for bigger projects like full kitchen and bathroom renovations. The goal is to figure out the minimum money we need to spend in order to get the maximum return on your investment.

**The great thing is that there’s no cost, no pressure, and absolutely no obligation to move forward with the project once we present our estimates for the repairs**. If you do decide to move forward, the whole construction process is taken off your hands and we manage the entire project with our own contractors and trades.

Once again this program is hassle-free and requires $0 upfront.

When your home is ready, we market it aggressively, negotiate all offers, and ultimately sell your house with the best terms and most money possible.

If you have any questions about the program, the market, or otherwise, make sure you give us a call at (407) 519-0627 or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
